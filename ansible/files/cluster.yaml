# One control plane node and two "workers".
#
# While these will not add more real compute capacity and
# have limited isolation, this can be useful for testing
# kubernetes and its features like rolling updates etc.
#
# The following configuration has also an additional
# part to forward ports from the host to an ingress
# controller running on a node.
